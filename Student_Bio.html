I've been tasked with creating frameworks for test execution processes ranging from lab setup and requirement analysis, to defect tracking and incorporating new test basis into the test cycle. I enjoy being involved in the technical aspect, too. In my spare time I catch up with family and spend time reading, however, lately I've been working on networking skills. I'm persistent, and very protective of my character, but these attributes enhance my dedication to quality in all aspects so its easy to manage. My resume speaks more to my education, however, I do hold a Bachelor of Science and ISTQB certifications (software testing).</p>
